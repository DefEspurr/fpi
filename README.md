fpi
----

FPI is the `Foreign Package Installer`, an `alien`-like utility for Solus that
converts between package formats. The initial idea is to convert `.deb` and `.rpm`
into native Solus `.eopkg` files for installation on Solus. This is used in more
extreme situations where certain packages are not readily usable on Solus due to
being restricted in format and distribution. The main goal is in providing the
user with at least _some method_ to install the packages locally.
